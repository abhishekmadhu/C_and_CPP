# C and CPP
<p>
  This repository contains a few of my experiments with C and C++.
</p>
<p>
  Most of the code is in the said languages.
</p>
<p>
  You will need a GCC (4.3.2 or higher) and g++ (4.3.2 or higher) 
  to compile all of these source codes. These are provided by default
  on most of the Linux distributions.
</p>
<p>
  NOTE: Most of these are compatible with Microsoft VC++ (Trademark of Microsoft).
